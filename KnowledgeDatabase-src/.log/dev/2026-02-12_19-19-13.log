(node:47456) [MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON] Warning: Module type of file:///D:/code/Large-scale-integrated-project/HNULS-LabHub/HNULS-KnowledgeDatabase/KnowledgeDatabase-src/postcss.config.js?t=1770895154133 is not specified and it doesn't parse as CommonJS.
Reparsing as ES module because module syntax was detected. This incurs a performance overhead.
To eliminate this warning, add "type": "module" to D:\code\Large-scale-integrated-project\HNULS-LabHub\HNULS-KnowledgeDatabase\KnowledgeDatabase-src\package.json.
